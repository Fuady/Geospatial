# Geospatial Data Science Book 101

This book offers a comprehensive and beginner-friendly introduction to Geospatial Data Science, blending essential theory with practical applications using Python. It starts by defining what geospatial data science is, why it matters in today's data-driven world, and introduces key concepts and tools.

You’ll learn to identify, acquire, and work with various types of geospatial data, exploring file formats and data sources. With hands-on Python examples, the book guides you through visualizing spatial data using popular libraries, and delves into core analytical techniques like spatial joins, clustering, interpolation, and kernel density estimation.

As you progress, you’ll explore how to apply machine learning techniques—from regression and classification to deep learning—specifically tailored for spatial datasets. Real-world case studies across industries such as urban planning, agriculture, transportation, and disaster management illustrate how geospatial data science solves complex problems.

The book also introduces Apache Sedona, a powerful tool for distributed spatial data processing, covering setup, operations, and optimization. Finally, you’ll learn how to build a complete geospatial data science project, from data collection to result presentation, and discover resources for further learning.

Whether you're a data science enthusiast, student, or professional aiming to enter the geospatial field, this book is your practical guide to mastering geospatial data science from the ground up.
